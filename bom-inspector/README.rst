Bakes on Mesh Inspector
=======================

This is a quick little HUD that displays the current Bakes on Mesh textures
for all 11 channels when worn.  Clicking on a texture will pop-up a larger
preview and clicking on that preview will make it go away again.

This HUD is full-perm and may be given away freely.  The script inside is no-mod
to prevent malicious modifications; you may find the source to the script at 
https://github.com/seriesumei/style/blob/master/bom-inspector/bom-inspector.lsl
if you want to see how it works or make changes to it yourself.

I hope you find it useful and thank you for taking the time to try it out!
